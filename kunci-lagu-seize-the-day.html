This constitutesan ample opportunity for Ir. Soekarno and Drs. Mohammad Hatta to proclaim Indonesia's independenceon 17 August 1945. The draft was prepared only a few hours before earlier, on the night of August 16, bySoekarno, Hatta, and a student named Subarjo.Adapted from: http://www.bali-directory.com/article/Independence DayofRepublicofindonesia.asptolong terjemahkan ya kak​</a>

                                            The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised up its global economic growth forecast to 3.6 percent in 2017 and 3.7 percent in 2018, as it projects a slight recovery in worldwide economic activity. The IMF's growth forecasts for both 2017 and 2018 are 0.1 percentage point stronger compared with its forecast back in April, the fund stated in its October edition of the World Economic Outlook (WEO). The latest WEO was published on Tuesday in Washington, D.C. In its forecast, the fund saw that some regions, including emerging Asia, had better-than-expected growth outcomes during the first half of this year, which more than offset the downward revisions for the United States and the United Kingdom. “But the recovery is not complete: while the baseline outlook is strengthening, growth remains weak in many countries, and inflation is below target in most advanced economies,” the report said. The IMF called for policymakers to seize "the window of opportunity in cyclical pickup of global economy". The IMF suggested that policymakers tackle their key policy challenges to boost potential economic output while ensuring its benefits were broadly shared, and to build resilience against downside risks. “Policymakers should seize the moment: the recovery is still incomplete in important respects, and the window for action the current cyclical upswing offers will not be open forever,” said IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld at a press conference during the ongoing 2017 IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings in Washington, D.C.

His teacher even decided to teach him a powerful magic called Pancasona  that will make anyone who learned it to be invulnerable or weapon resistant.All of his knowledge didn't make him arrogant. He loves to help everyone. One day, Pitung attacked by the Dutch but Pitung was so agile that he could dodge almost all of their move. The dutch attacked him ferociously because it has no effect on him. When the dutch move seemed to get slow, Pitung launched his attack and he took them down one by one so easily. After that, the thugs ran away, but before that they threatened him that they would report his action to the landlord. When the thugs had gone, the villagers went out from their house and thanked him for his help.Ever since that day, Pitung decided to protect his village from thugs and evil landlord who sent them.

They made rather odd travelling companions because one of them was incapable of ever telling the truth and could only tell lie whereas the other could not tell a lie if his life depended on it, but could only ever say the truth as he saw it. They had been travelling for some time, when they came to the land of the monkeys. The king of the monkeys heard that two strangers had arrived in his realm, and he was very keen to impress them with his magnificence and power, so he ordered to have them brought before himHe arranged to receive them seated on his throne in his state room, in the middle of his palace, and had a large retinue of courtiers and servants lined up in long rows, both inside the room and along all the passages on the way in As they made their way towards the state room, the travelers were quite nervous, and they bowed when they came before the More the kingThe king welcomed them heartily, and then asked them they'd ever been in the presence of a mightier king. The traveler who always lied spoke first. "Sire, I have travelled all over the world, and never before have I been so impressed by the splendor and might of your court! The king seemed to be quite pleased to hear this, and he asked, "And what do you think of my subjects?"Stre, replied the lying traveler, "your subjects must be the most fortunate people I have ever come across in all my extensive travels, fortunate to be ruled by such a splendid and mighty monarch as you are!" The monkey king was delighted with this answer, he clapped his hands and called on his servants to prepare a magnificent feast for this guest, and to ensure that his every need was taken care of. Then he turned to the other traveler and asked him the same question.This was of course the traveler who could only tell the truth as he saw it, and he said: "Sire, I think you are a fine ape, and all the subject you rule over are very fine apes too!" The king of the monkeys was enraged when he heard this, and he jumped from his throne. He ordered his guards to seize the luckless traveler and to beat him to deathclapped:impressed:lies:magnificent:palace:splendid:throne:travelling:plis bntu?trath:​</a>

The Hunter, the Fox, and the TigerA certain hunter saw in the middle of a field a fox, whose skin was so beautiful that he was inspired with a great desire to take him alive. Having this in view, he found out his hole, and just before the entrance to it, he dug a large and deep pit, which he covered with slender twigs and straw, and placed a piece of horseflesh in the middle of it. When he had done this, he went and hid himself in a corner out of sight and the Fox, returning to his hole and smelling the flesh, ran up to see what dainty morsel it was. When he came to the pit, he would fain have tasted the meat, but fearing some tricks he refrained from doing so, and retreated into his hole. Presently up came a hungry tiger who being tempted by the smell and appearance of the horseflesh, sprang in haste to seize it, and tumbled into the pit. The hunter, hearing the noise made by the Tiger in falling, ran up and jumped into the pit without looking into it, never doubting that it was the Fox that had fallen in. But there, to his surprise, he found Tiger, which quickly tore him in pieces and devoured him.Why did the hunter want to take the Fox alive? Because …a. The Fox is very nice to himb.

He said to the monkey that he had found a shop in the woods but did not use it because he had been saving for him as treasure trove of his kingdom, and counseled him to seize it.

Incident occurred on August 16, 1945 at 04.00. WIB, Sukarno and Hatta were taken to Rengasdengklok, Falkirk, to be urged to expedite the proclamation of independence of the Republic of Indonesia, through theagreement between the old groups represented by Sukarno and Hatta and Mr.. Achmad Subardjo with a young group of when the proclamation will be implemented.Faced with such pressure, Soekarno and Hatta remain volatile. Meanwhile in Jakarta, Chairul and his colleagues have devised a plan to seize power. But what has been planned is not successfully executed because not all members of the MAP supports the plan.Proclamation of Independence of the Republic of Indonesia plans to read Bung Karno and Bung Hatta on Friday, August 17, 1945 at Ikada field (which has now become the field Monas) or at home Bung Karno Stadium in East Jl.Pegangsaan 56.

Hatta, leaders want the proclamation made through PPKI, while youth groups want the proclamation made quickly without going through the agency PPKI regarded as made in Japan. In addition, it is done so that Sukarno and Moh. Hatta is not affected by the Japanese.

                                            Early every morning, a shepherd took his flock of sheep out in the fields to graze. He would sit by watching – as the sheep lazily munched on fresh grass. After they had eaten, he would round them up and walk back home. Sometimes while watching his flock, he would curl up in a quiet corner and go off to sleep.One day, the shepherd caught a wolf which had strayed into the field, eyeing his sheep. However, it was some distance away and it made no effort to come nearer. The shepherd at first stood on guard against the wolf, as against an enemy, and kept a strict watch over its movements.But the wolf did not do anything. When the shepherd herded the sheep and headed home with his flock, the wolf quietly followed them at a distance.This continued for a while. The shepherd would find the wolf waiting at the edge of the field every morning. But it made not the slightest effort to seize the sheep and would just watch. So, by and by, the shepherd let down his guard a bit. A few days later, he began to actually look forward to the wolf’s presence.terjemahin ke bhs indonesia ya</a>

                                            Early every morning, a shepherd took his flock of sheep out in the fields to graze. He would sit by watching – as the sheep lazily munched on fresh grass. After they had eaten, he would round them up and walk back home. Sometimes while watching his flock, he would curl up in a quiet corner and go off to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, the shepherd caught a wolf which had strayed into the field, eyeing his sheep. However, it was some distance away and it made no effort to come nearer. The shepherd at first stood on guard against the wolf, as against an enemy, and kept a strict watch over its movements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the wolf did not do anything. When the shepherd herded the sheep and headed home with his flock, the wolf quietly followed them at a distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This continued for a while. The shepherd would find the wolf waiting at the edge of the field every morning. But it made not the slightest effort to seize the sheep and would just watch. So, by and by, the shepherd let down his guard a bit. A few days later, he began to actually look forward to the wolf’s presence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;terjemahin ke bhs indonesia ya</a>

Having this in view, he found out his hole, and just before the entrance to it, he dug a large and deep pit, which he covered with slender twigs and straw, and placed a piece of horseflesh in the middle of it. When he had done this, he went and hid himself in a corner out of sight and the Fox, returning to his hole and smelling the flesh, ran up to see what dainty morsel it was. When he came to the pit, he would fain have tasted the meat, but fearing some tricks he refrained from doing so, and retreated into his hole. Presently up came a hungry tiger who being tempted by the smell and appearance of the horseflesh, sprang in haste to seize it, and tumbled into the pit. The hunter, hearing the noise made by the Tiger in falling, ran up and jumped into the pit without looking into it, never doubting that it was the Fox that had fallen in. But there, to his surprise, he found Tiger, which quickly tore him in pieces and devoured him.What is the purpose of the text above?a.To entertain the readersb. To explain about natural phenomenac.

Reading and WritingTask 2Read the highlights of Indonesia's long historical journey, since the Dutch colonialism until theproclamation of Indonesia's independence. Then, complete the table with the right year. Compareyour answers with your partner's.Indonesian Independence DayThe Beginning of Dutch ColonialismIn their search for spices, the Portuguese arrived in Indonesia in 1511, followed by the Spaniards.Later, the Dutch also started their search for spices in Indonesia, which they sold in European marketswith big profits, and established the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1602.In 1605, Dutch colonialism began to have a foothold over Indonesian territories. The capital of SundaKelapa was named "Batavia" by the Dutch.British Temporary RuleIn 1714, the British came to Indonesia and built Fort York in Bengkulu on the west coast of Sumatrawhich was later renamed Fort Marlborough. The British stayed in Bengkulu until 1825.During the Napoleonic wars in Europe when Holland was occupied by France, Indonesia fell under therule of the British East India Company (1811-1816). Sir Thomas Stanford Raffles was appointed LieutenantGovernor General of Java and dependencies.Return of Dutch ColonialismSoon the Dutch strengthened their colonial rule. But this only sparked rebellions to seize freedom.Thomas Matulessy (Pattimura) staged a revolt against the Dutch in the Moluccas (1816-1818). PrinceDiponegoro of Mataram led a fierce struggle for freedom which was known as the Java War from 1825-1830. Tuanku Imam Bonjol led the Padri War in West Sumatera, while Teuku Umar headed the Aceh Warin North Sumatera (1873-1903). King Sisingamangaraja of the Bataks revolved against the Dutch in 1907.An attempt by the Dutch troops to occupy Bali in 1908 was repelled by King Udayana. Revolts were alsoerupting in Goa, South Sulawesi, and in South Kalimantan.Nationalist MovementsWhen all those regional wars of independence failed, Indonesian nationalists began thinking of amore organized struggle against Dutch colonialism. The move began with the founding of Boedi Oetomoby Dr. Soetomo on 20 May 1908. This organization of Indonesian intellectuals was initially set up foreducational purposes but later turned into politics.In 1924, Perhimpunan Mahasiswa Indonesia (the Indonesian Students Association) was formed byDrs. Mohammad Hatta, Dr. Sukiman and others. This organization became a driving force of the nationalistmovement to gain independence.On 28 October 1928, delegates to Indonesian Youth Congress in Jakarta pledged commitment toOne Nation, One Motherland and One Language. The "Indonesia Raya" song was introduced for the firsttime at the 2nd Indonesian Youth Congress by its composer, Wage Rudolf Supratman.The Japanese OccupationAfter the Japanese attacks of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, Japanese Armed Forces occupied severalSoutheast Asian countries. After the fall of Singapore, Japanese invaded the Dutch East Indies and theDutch colonial army surrendered in March 1942. Soekarno and Hatta were released from their detention.ProclamationThe final defeat of Japan after the dropping of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki on the 6thand 9 of August 1945 prompted the Japanese to surrender unconditionally to the Allies. This constitutesan ample opportunity for Ir. Soekarno and Drs. Mohammad Hatta to proclaim Indonesia's independenceon 17 August 1945. The draft was prepared only a few hours before earlier, on the night of August 16, bySoekarno, Hatta, and a student named Subarjo.Adapted from: http://www.bali-directory.com/article/Independence DayofRepublicofindonesia.asptolong terjemahkan ya kak​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Awal Mula Kolonialisme Belanda</p><p>Dalam pencarian mereka untuk rempah-rempah, Portugis tiba di Indonesia pada tahun 1511, diikuti oleh orang-orang Spanyol. Belakangan, Belanda juga mulai mencari rempah-rempah di Indonesia, yang mereka jual di pasar Eropa</p><p>dengan keuntungan besar, dan mendirikan Dutch East India Company (VOC) pada 1602. Pada 1605, kolonialisme Belanda mulai memiliki pijakan di wilayah Indonesia. Ibukota Sunda</p><p>Kelapa dinamai "Batavia" oleh Belanda.Peraturan Sementara Inggris </p><p>Pada 1714, Inggris datang ke Indonesia dan membangun Fort York di Bengkulu di pantai barat Sumatra yang kemudian dinamai Fort Marlborough. Inggris tetap di Bengkulu sampai 1825. Selama perang Napoleon di Eropa ketika Belanda diduduki oleh Perancis, Indonesia jatuh di bawah aturan British East India Company (1811-1816). Sir Thomas Stanford Raffles diangkat sebagai Letnan Gubernur Jenderal Jawa dan dependensi. Kembalinya Kolonialisme Belanda</p><p>Segera Belanda memperkuat pemerintahan kolonial mereka. Tapi ini hanya memicu pemberontak. Thomas Matulessy (Pattimura) melancarkan pemberontakan terhadap Belanda di Maluku (1816-1818). Pangeran Diponegoro dari Mataram memimpin perjuangan sengit untuk kebebasan yang dikenal sebagai Perang Jawa dari 1825-1830. Tuanku Imam Bonjol memimpin Perang Padri di Sumatera Barat, sementara Teuku Umar memimpin Perang Aceh di Sumatera Utara (1873-1903). Raja Sisingamangaraja dari Batak berputar melawan Belanda pada tahun 1907. Upaya pasukan Belanda untuk menduduki Bali pada tahun 1908 ditolak oleh Raja Udayana. Pemberontakan juga terjadi di Goa, Sulawesi Selatan, dan di Kalimantan Selatan. Gerakan Nasionalis Ketika semua perang kemerdekaan regional itu gagal, kaum nasionalis Indonesia mulai memikirkan perjuangan yang lebih terorganisir melawan kolonialisme Belanda. Langkah ini dimulai dengan pendirian Boedi Oetomo oleh Dr. Soetomo pada 20 Mei 1908. Organisasi intelektual Indonesia ini awalnya dibentuk untuk tujuan pendidikan tetapi kemudian berubah menjadi politik. Pada tahun 1924, Perhimpunan Mahasiswa Indonesia (Persatuan Pelajar Indonesia) dibentuk oleh</p><p>Drs.

Pada tanggal 28 Oktober 1928, delegasi ke Kongres Pemuda Indonesia di Jakarta berjanji untuk Satu Bangsa, Satu Tanah Air dan Satu Bahasa. Lagu "Indonesia Raya" diperkenalkan untuk yang pertama waktu di Kongres Pemuda Indonesia ke-2 oleh komposernya, Wage Rudolf Supratman.

Setelah jatuhnya Singapura, Jepang menginvasi Hindia Belanda dan Belanda</p><p>Tentara kolonial Belanda menyerah pada bulan Maret 1942. Soekarno dan Hatta dibebaskan dari penahanan mereka. Proklamasi Kekalahan terakhir Jepang setelah dijatuhkannya bom atom di Hiroshima dan Nagasaki pada tanggal 6 dan 9 Agustus 1945 mendorong Jepang untuk menyerah tanpa syarat kepada Sekutu. Ini merupakan kesempatan yang luas bagi Ir. Soekarno dan Drs. Mohammad Hatta untuk memproklamasikan kemerdekaan Indonesia</p><p>pada 17 Agustus 1945.

                        <p>Makna lagu <strong>Make A Wave</strong><strong> </strong>oleh Demi Lovato dan Joe Jonas<strong> </strong>ini adalah <strong>semangat bagi mereka yang merasa dirinya terlalu kecil atau lemah dan tak bisa membuat perubahan atau hal-hal berarti/besar. </strong>Padahal, menurut lagu ini, hal besar dimulai dari hal kecil. Bahkan kerikil pun bisa membuat gelombang di air. Ini bermakna, walau kita merasa bukan siapa-siapa, yakini dengan usaha tekun dan kepercayaan penuh, kamu bisa membuat perubahan selayaknya kerikil kecil yang mampu membuat air beriak ketika dilemparkan.</p>» Pembahasan<p>Judul dalam lagu ini adalah ‘Make A Wave’,<strong> </strong>secara harfiah tentu dimaknai buatlah gelombang, ciptakan gelombang dan semacamnya. Namun jika kita memahami keseluruhan makna lagu ini maka ‘make a wave’ akan dimaknai sebagai <strong>‘buatlah perubahan’</strong>, <strong>‘ciptakan perubahan’ </strong>dan lain-lain. </p><p>Pada awal lagu kita disuguhi pengandaian, bagaimana kepakan sayap kupu-kupu bisa memicu badai. Liriknya adalah sebagai berikut:</p>They say the beat of a butterflies wings,Can set off a storm the world away<p>Kepak kupu-kupu yang bisa memicu badai ini merujuk pada teori yang diyakini banyak orang.<strong> Teori tersebut dinamakan Butterfly Effect </strong>dimana ada <strong>keyakinan dalam sains bahwa perubahan kecil yang terjadi pada suatu titik (tak linear sekalipun) bisa memicu perubahan besar ke depannya. </strong>Lagu ini mempertanyakan kebenaran tersebut. Bagaimana jika memang benar, langkah kecil yang kita buat hari ini bisa membawa kita pada hal besar? Maka jangan pernah merasa diri kecil, jangan pernah merasa diri tak berguna sebab langkah sekecil apapun bisa memicu perubahan besar selayaknya kepak kupu-kupu dalam <strong>Butterfly Effect</strong> dan lagu<strong> ‘Make A Wave'.</strong></p><p>Lagu ini mengajak kita untuk terus berupaya sehingga lirik ‘make a wave’ paling banyak diulang.

                            11. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised up its global economic growth forecast to 3.6 percent in 2017 and 3.7 percent in 2018, as it projects a slight recovery in worldwide economic activity. The IMF's growth forecasts for both 2017 and 2018 are 0.1 percentage point stronger compared with its forecast back in April, the fund stated in its October edition of the World Economic Outlook (WEO). The latest WEO was published on Tuesday in Washington, D.C. In its forecast, the fund saw that some regions, including emerging Asia, had better-than-expected growth outcomes during the first half of this year, which more than offset the downward revisions for the United States and the United Kingdom. “But the recovery is not complete: while the baseline outlook is strengthening, growth remains weak in many countries, and inflation is below target in most advanced economies,” the report said. The IMF called for policymakers to seize "the window of opportunity in cyclical pickup of global economy". The IMF suggested that policymakers tackle their key policy challenges to boost potential economic output while ensuring its benefits were broadly shared, and to build resilience against downside risks. “Policymakers should seize the moment: the recovery is still incomplete in important respects, and the window for action the current cyclical upswing offers will not be open forever,” said IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld at a press conference during the ongoing 2017 IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings in Washington, D.C.

Activity 1Read the story below and find the meaning of the words listed.The King of the Monkeys and the Two Travelers Two men were travelling together through a distant land. They made rather odd travelling companions because one of them was incapable of ever telling the truth and could only tell lie whereas the other could not tell a lie if his life depended on it, but could only ever say the truth as he saw it. They had been travelling for some time, when they came to the land of the monkeys. The king of the monkeys heard that two strangers had arrived in his realm, and he was very keen to impress them with his magnificence and power, so he ordered to have them brought before himHe arranged to receive them seated on his throne in his state room, in the middle of his palace, and had a large retinue of courtiers and servants lined up in long rows, both inside the room and along all the passages on the way in As they made their way towards the state room, the travelers were quite nervous, and they bowed when they came before the More the kingThe king welcomed them heartily, and then asked them they'd ever been in the presence of a mightier king. The traveler who always lied spoke first. "Sire, I have travelled all over the world, and never before have I been so impressed by the splendor and might of your court! The king seemed to be quite pleased to hear this, and he asked, "And what do you think of my subjects?"Stre, replied the lying traveler, "your subjects must be the most fortunate people I have ever come across in all my extensive travels, fortunate to be ruled by such a splendid and mighty monarch as you are!" The monkey king was delighted with this answer, he clapped his hands and called on his servants to prepare a magnificent feast for this guest, and to ensure that his every need was taken care of. Then he turned to the other traveler and asked him the same question.This was of course the traveler who could only tell the truth as he saw it, and he said: "Sire, I think you are a fine ape, and all the subject you rule over are very fine apes too!" The king of the monkeys was enraged when he heard this, and he jumped from his throne. He ordered his guards to seize the luckless traveler and to beat him to deathclapped:impressed:lies:magnificent:palace:splendid:throne:travelling:plis bntu?trath:​</h2><br />

The Hunter, the Fox, and the TigerA certain hunter saw in the middle of a field a fox, whose skin was so beautiful that he was inspired with a great desire to take him alive. Having this in view, he found out his hole, and just before the entrance to it, he dug a large and deep pit, which he covered with slender twigs and straw, and placed a piece of horseflesh in the middle of it. When he had done this, he went and hid himself in a corner out of sight and the Fox, returning to his hole and smelling the flesh, ran up to see what dainty morsel it was. When he came to the pit, he would fain have tasted the meat, but fearing some tricks he refrained from doing so, and retreated into his hole. Presently up came a hungry tiger who being tempted by the smell and appearance of the horseflesh, sprang in haste to seize it, and tumbled into the pit. The hunter, hearing the noise made by the Tiger in falling, ran up and jumped into the pit without looking into it, never doubting that it was the Fox that had fallen in. But there, to his surprise, he found Tiger, which quickly tore him in pieces and devoured him.Why did the hunter want to take the Fox alive? Because …a. The Fox is very nice to himb.

                            28. Early every morning, a shepherd took his flock of sheep out in the fields to graze. He would sit by watching – as the sheep lazily munched on fresh grass. After they had eaten, he would round them up and walk back home. Sometimes while watching his flock, he would curl up in a quiet corner and go off to sleep.One day, the shepherd caught a wolf which had strayed into the field, eyeing his sheep. However, it was some distance away and it made no effort to come nearer. The shepherd at first stood on guard against the wolf, as against an enemy, and kept a strict watch over its movements.But the wolf did not do anything. When the shepherd herded the sheep and headed home with his flock, the wolf quietly followed them at a distance.This continued for a while.

                        Setiap pagi, seorang gembala mengambil kawanan dombanya di ladang untuk merumput. Dia akan duduk dengan menonton - sebagai domba malas mengunyah rumput segar. Setelah mereka makan, ia akan mengumpulkan mereka dan berjalan kembali ke rumah. Kadang-kadang saat menonton umatnya, ia akan meringkuk di sudut yang tenang dan pergi tidur.<br /><br />Suatu hari, gembala menangkap serigala yang kesasar ke lapangan, mengamati domba-dombanya. Namun, itu agak jauh dan itu membuat tidak ada usaha untuk datang lebih dekat. gembala pada awalnya berdiri waspada terhadap serigala, sebagai melawan musuh, dan terus mengawasi ketat selama gerakannya.<br /><br />Tapi serigala tidak melakukan apa-apa. Ketika gembala menggiring domba dan menuju rumah dengan umatnya, serigala itu diam-diam mengikuti mereka dari jauh.<br /><br />Ini berlanjut untuk sementara waktu. gembala akan menemukan serigala menunggu di pinggir lapangan setiap pagi. Tapi itu membuat tidak sedikit usaha untuk merebut domba dan hanya akan menonton. Jadi, oleh dan oleh, gembala menurunkan penjaga nya sedikit. Beberapa hari kemudian, ia mulai benar-benar melihat ke depan untuk kehadiran serigala.<br /><br /><br />semoga membantu<br />

After they had eaten, he would round them up and walk back home. Sometimes while watching his flock, he would curl up in a quiet corner and go off to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, the shepherd caught a wolf which had strayed into the field, eyeing his sheep. However, it was some distance away and it made no effort to come nearer. The shepherd at first stood on guard against the wolf, as against an enemy, and kept a strict watch over its movements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the wolf did not do anything. When the shepherd herded the sheep and headed home with his flock, the wolf quietly followed them at a distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This continued for a while. The shepherd would find the wolf waiting at the edge of the field every morning. But it made not the slightest effort to seize the sheep and would just watch.

The Hunter, the Fox, and the TigerA certain hunter saw in the middle of a field a fox, whose skin was so beautiful that he was inspired with a great desire to take him alive. Having this in view, he found out his hole, and just before the entrance to it, he dug a large and deep pit, which he covered with slender twigs and straw, and placed a piece of horseflesh in the middle of it. When he had done this, he went and hid himself in a corner out of sight and the Fox, returning to his hole and smelling the flesh, ran up to see what dainty morsel it was. When he came to the pit, he would fain have tasted the meat, but fearing some tricks he refrained from doing so, and retreated into his hole. Presently up came a hungry tiger who being tempted by the smell and appearance of the horseflesh, sprang in haste to seize it, and tumbled into the pit. The hunter, hearing the noise made by the Tiger in falling, ran up and jumped into the pit without looking into it, never doubting that it was the Fox that had fallen in. But there, to his surprise, he found Tiger, which quickly tore him in pieces and devoured him.What is the purpose of the text above?a.To entertain the readersb. To explain about natural phenomenac.

            Dahulu
kala, ada sepasang Raja dan Ratu yang berbahagia, karena setelah bertahun-tahun
lamanya, akhirnya Ratu melahirkan seorang Puteri. 

Raja dan Ratu mengundang tujuh
peri untuk datang dan memberkati Puteri yang baru saja lahir itu.


            Dalam
acara megah yang diselenggarakan sebagai penghormatan kepada para peri itu,
masing-masing peri memberikan berkat kepada sang Puteri.

            Peri
pertama mengatakan “Kamu akan menjadi Puteri tercantik di dunia.”Peri kedua
mengatakan “Kamu akan menjadi seorang Puteri yang periang.”Peri ketiga
mengatakan “Kamu akan selalu mendapatkan banyak kasih sayang.”Peri keempat
mengatakan “Kamu akan dapat menari dengan sangat anggun.”Peri kelima mengatakan
“Kamu akan dapat bernyanyi dengan sangat merdu.” Peri keenam mengatakan “Kamu
akan sangat pintar memainkan alat musik.”

            Tiba
- tiba datang peri tua ke tengah acara itu. Ia sangat marah karena tidak
diundang. Semua orang memang sudah lama tidak pernah melihat peri tua itu, dan
mengira bahwa ia sudah meninggal atau pergi dari kerajaan itu.

            Peri
tua yang marah itu mendekati sang Puteri dan mengutuknya “Jarimu akan tertusuk
jarum pintal dan kamu akan mati!” dan kemudian peri tua itu pun menghilang.

Semua orang sangat terkejut. Ratu
pun mulai menangis.

            Peri
ketujuh mendekati sang Puteri dan memberikan berkatnya “Aku tidak bisa
membatalkan kutukan, tapi aku dapat memberikan berkatku supaya Puteri tidak
akan mati karena terkena jarum pintal, melainkan hanya tertidur pulas selama
seratus tahun. Setelah seratus tahun, seorang Pangeran tampan akan datang untuk
membangunkannya.”

            Raja
dan Ratu merasa sedikit lega mendengarnya. Mereka lalu mengeluarkan peraturan
baru bahwa di kerajaan itu tidak boleh ada alat pintal satu pun. Mereka menyita
dan menghancurkan semua alat pintal yang ada di kerajaan itu demi selamatan
sang Puteri. Pada suatu hari disaat Puteri berusia 18 tahun, Raja dan Ratu
pergi sepanjang hari.

            Karena
kesepian, sang Puteri berjalan-jalan menjelajahi istana dan sampai di sebuah
loteng. Disana ia menjumpai seorang wanita tua yang sedang memintal benang
menggunakan alat pintal. Karena belum pernah melihat alat pintal, sang Puteri
sangat tertarik dan ingin mencoba. 

            Wanita
tua itu sebenarnya adalah peri tua jahat yang dulu mengutuknya. Saat sang
Puteri mencoba alat pintal itu, ia pun dengan sengaja menusukkan jarum pintal
ke tangan sang Puteri. 

            Sang
Puteri jatuh tak sadarkan diri dan tertidur karena terkena kutukan. Peri tua
jahat tertawa puas dan menghilang dalam kegelapan. 

            Saat
Raja dan Ratu kembali, mereka dan seluruh pegawai kerajaan kebingungan mencari
sang Puteri. Saat mereka menemukannya, Raja tersadar bahwa kutukan peri tua
jahat telah menjadi kenyataan. Sang Puteri lalu dibawa ke kamarnya dan dibaringkan
di tempat tidurnya. Raja lalu mengirimkan kabar mengenai peristiwa itu ke peri
ketujuh yang baik hati. 

Peri ketujuh yang baik hati lalu
bergegas ke istana. Ia memutuskan untuk menidurkan semua orang di kerajaan itu
supaya kelak saat kutukan sang Puteri berakhir mereka semua akan bangun
bersama-sama. 

            Dalam
waktu singkat pohon-pohon besar dan semak belukar yang lebat dan berduri tumbuh
di seluruh wilayah kerajaan, sehingga sangat sulit bagi siapapun untuk
menerobosnya. Bahkan puncak-puncak istana pun hanya dapat terlihat ujungnya
saja. Karena menjadi sangat tertutup, sang Puteri dan seluruh kerajaan menjadi
aman, walaupun mereka semua tertidur. 

            Setelah
masa seratus tahun berakhir, seorang Pangeran tampan yang kebetulan sedang
berburu di dekat wilayah kerajaan itu melihat pucuk-pucuk istana itu. Ia sudah
banyak mendengar cerita tentang kerajaan itu, antara lain tentang istana yang
dianggap berhantu, para penyihir, dan cerita-cerita lain yang sangat menyeramkan
yang sebenarnya tidak benar. 

Karena penasaran, saat kembali
dari berburu sang Pangeran mencari orang tua yang paling bijaksana dan pintar
di kerajaan untuk menanyakan tentang kerajaan tetangga yang penuh misteri itu.
